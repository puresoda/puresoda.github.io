Haha, so this is what I've been working on for the past month. Sorry that I'm so bad at keeping secrets, I always get a bit too excited to show you what I'm doing, especially things that I know will make you happy. This year's truly been an adventure with you. Even though nothing this year went as planned, I'm still so grateful to have been able to spend it with you. You made this year bearable and I can't wait for all the time we'll get to spend together in the future. Anyways, I hope you enjoy the scavenger hunt! I'll be beside you the whole time in case you get stuck. Good luck! <br><br> Can you believe it's already been over a year since we met at the beach? I was so nervous the night before that I couldn't sleep at all, practicing conversation topics and remembering how to talk without sounding awkward until 3am. Remembering how much fun I had talking to you when you visited LA, I had already had a bit of a crush on you. But after those two days ended, I didn't expect to see you again. Fast forward two years and the same cute and sweet girl was inviting me to the beach? Needless to say, I was a bit flustered and didn't want to ruin my chance. That day, I had so much fun with you, from talking at Loose Leaf to hanging out at Laguna Beach. We spent almost the entire day just talking about random stuff yet I'll never forget it. During the beach, seeing you smiling and laughing as the sun set and the waves crashed behind you was magical and I knew then that I had completely fallen for you. After we had to part ways the next day, I couldn't get you off of my mind. I wanted so badly to message you again or to see you in person, but I was too shy and scared back then. But when you invited me to Disneyland, I knew that I couldn't let you go so easily. Did you know that it took me over 40 minutes to type out my first message to you? Surprising that I can't even remember what that first message was now. I think it was either complaining about my land lady or congratulating you on finishing your internship though! I was so nervous at messing up a chance to get to know you better that I sat there for almost an hour for a couple of sentences of text. Haha, looking back on it now, it seems a bit silly how much I was freaking out about it, but I'm glad everything turned out the way it did. Every bit of nervousness, excitement, and enamor I had for you was real and they led to where we are now. Even after everything, we've been through, I'll still remember you as the girl who stole my heart smiling at the beach.  

It took almost four months from when we met at the beach and at Disneyland to when I could see you again in the Bay. While I was excited for your opportunity to explore Europe while studying abroad in Scotland, part of me missed you back then even though I had only met you three times at that point. That quarter, you were always on my mind (except while taking finals, my brain got a bit fried haha). I always looked forward to all of your messages, from when you updated me about your travels to mundane things like how cold it was in Scotland. With every message I read, I learned more about you and each message brought a smile to my face and brightened my day a bit (and still does). Even though I wanted to see you in person, I was glad to be able to be a part of your life and talk. Despite the eight hour time difference between us, I appreacited the back and forth conversations we had. Sometimes I stayed up an extra ten or fifteen minutes because I was hoping you would message me when you got up. For once, my awful sleep schedule helped me out because I was able to talk to you a bit more regularly, especially that day I stayed up until 5am writing my essay and I got to talk to you for thirty minutes after you finished class. There were so many nights where I wanted to message you and tell you how I really felt. I stared at my phone and thought of how much of a weight would be lifted off my shoulders if I had told you everything: how much I liked you, how I couldn't stop thinking about you since the beack, and how I wanted to talk to you so much more in person once you got back. I actually got pretty close to doing that one night I got a bit drunk. I had written the message and almost hit send before I sobered up a bit and my roommate also snapped me out of it. Although waiting for you was hard at times, I'm so glad that I did. I'll cherish every message we sent, every small misunderstanding we had because we were shy, and every emotion you made me feel that quarter. With the way everything has turned out, I wouldn't change anything about those four months because they led me to you.
